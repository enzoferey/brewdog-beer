# brewdog-beer

Web app to display beers from https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2

## Usage

## Architecture

## Notes

- "Methods" were always referred in plural, however in the API data the field is singular and an object type rather an array. The app also works when the field is an array but it adds complexity and it's confusing.
